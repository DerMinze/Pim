/*
	The Layer is the "top level" controller of your game, which is customizeable
	by you. It acts like a regular GameNode in terms of children and parent relationship,
	and multiple Layers can be added to your screen at any given time. For instance,
	the most sensible thing to do is attach all user interface objects on one layer,
	and have the game visuals on another.

	IMPORTANT NOTICE ABOUT LAYER RELATIONSHIPS AND UI!
	A Layer containing game objects is movable. I.e., you can move the layer opposite of
	the direction the player is moving, thus "scrolling the world". In order for any UI-layers
	to stand completely still, you NEED to flag the Layer as an 'immovableLayer'. This will cause
	the "getWorldPosition()" method to return (0,0)+(position) no matter what.
	Failure to flag immovable will cause the same method to return
	(parent->worldPosition())+(position) - which effectively would scroll the UI along with the
	world. Any sub-layers to the UI layer can be treated however you'd like, as the UI layer
	will return a constant value regardless of it's parent.

	As the top level Layer will not have a parent, it is flagged as "topLayer", and a
	static pointer is set to point to this layer. It can be accessed through the static method
	Layer::getTopLayer().

	There must always be a top layer. Even if you were to strike down the top layer, a new
	top layer must take it's place. This is handled automatically by the GameController
	when you attach a new Layer to it.

	 @class 		Layer
	 @brief 		Defines a layer. Intermediate object most commonly used between
	 				the Scene and your Sprites.
	 @details 		The Layer derives from GameNode, and as such it can be added
	 				as child to any other GameNode â€” however, it is also @e required
	 				to rule your node hierarchy, only triumphed by your Scene.
	 
	 				A @e very basic node hierarchy has the following structure:
	 					Scene  -->  Layer  -->  Sprites
	 				
	 				However, given the dynamic nature of GameNodes, you may have
	 				something totally off the bat, like this:
	 					Scene  -->  Layer  --> GameNode  --> Layer  -->  Layer
	 			
	 				Note that in both the simple and complex example, the first
	 				two nodes are identical:  Scene  -->  Layer.
	 
	 				The Layer is capable of post processing shaders (performed by
	 				rendering the entire sub-tree of the Layer onto a texture and
	 				re-rendering the texture and applying the shader), and lighting
	 				system functionality using soft / hard shadows in real-time.
